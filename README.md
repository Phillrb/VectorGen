The OSX app is a document-based application written in objective-c for Xcode. 
Visually represent vectors by creating and manipulating a series of points on a preview screen. 'Vectrex code', representing the vector asset, is dynamically generated and dispalyed for reference. 

Highlights include:
- design vector assests via an interactive GUI
- overlay transparent images for tracing over or for image comparison
- vectrex compatible relative coordiates produced
- snap to grid
- save and open vector assets
